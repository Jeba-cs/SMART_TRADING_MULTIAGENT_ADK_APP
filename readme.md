## Inspiration

We were inspired by the complexity of modern financial markets and saw an opportunity to leverage multi-agent systems for smarter trading decisions. Traditional trading bots often operate in silos, while our approach enables collaborative intelligence where specialized agents work together like a hedge fund team.

---

## Features

- **Autonomous AI Agents:** Specialized agents for market data, news sentiment, social media, economic indicators, technical/fundamental analysis, risk, and compliance.
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Aggregates and analyzes live market, news, and social data.
- **Automated Portfolio Optimization:** Intelligent decision-making and trade execution.
- **Compliance & Performance Monitoring:** Ensures regulatory adherence and tracks trading performance.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of order books, price charts, sentiment, and portfolio summaries.
- **Cloud-Native Scalability:** Built on Google Cloud for reliability and performance.
- **Backtesting & Analytics:** Historical simulation and advanced analytics with BigQuery.
