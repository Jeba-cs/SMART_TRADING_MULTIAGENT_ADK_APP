Inspiration
We were inspired by the complexity of modern financial markets and saw an opportunity to leverage multi-agent systems for smarter trading decisions. Traditional trading bots often operate in silos, while our approach enables collaborative intelligence where specialized agents work together like a hedge fund team.

Features
Autonomous AI Agents: Specialized agents for market data, news sentiment, social media, economic indicators, technical/fundamental analysis, risk, and compliance.

Real-Time Data Collection: Aggregates and analyzes live market, news, and social data.

Automated Portfolio Optimization: Intelligent decision-making and trade execution.

Compliance & Performance Monitoring: Ensures regulatory adherence and tracks trading performance.

Streamlit Dashboard: Real-time visualization of order books, price charts, sentiment, and portfolio summaries.

Cloud-Native Scalability: Built on Google Cloud for reliability and performance.

Backtesting & Analytics: Historical simulation and advanced analytics with BigQuery.
